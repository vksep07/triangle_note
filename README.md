# Plateron Shopping Cart App  ( :smile: ) [ Ios and Android ]

"Plateron" app is to provide a comprehensive and instructive showcase of a shopping application. It spotlights fundamental e-commerce features while making use of prominent Flutter libraries and design patterns. Through this demonstration, the app serves as a valuable learning resource for developers and enthusiasts, illustrating how to build a robust and user-friendly shopping platform that encompasses essential functionalities, advanced state management, and responsive user interfaces.

In this app we are showing the intaractive UI interface with static custom json data  to understand the basic flow. In this project we are using the clean architecture  with following folder breakup -> Parent folder - ( View, Bloc, Network ). We are using the modular approach for reduce the modular dependency between the each module of the project. Clean architecture also decouple the presentation layer and business layer.
