# Triangle Note App  ( :smile: ) [ Flutter Ios and Android ]
 
"Triangle Note" app serves as a comprehensive and educational platform for showcasing note-taking functionality. Users are provided with features to register and log in through dedicated screens, enabling secure access to their notes. Within the app, users can create notes for various purposes, such as reminders or quick data references. Additionally, users have the option to mark notes as important for easy identification and delete them once they are no longer needed.

This demonstration of note-taking functionality serves as a valuable learning resource for developers and enthusiasts alike. It illustrates the process of building a robust and user-friendly application, showcasing essential functionalities, advanced state management techniques, and responsive user interfaces. The interactive UI interface, coupled with a local SQLite database, offers insight into the app's basic flow and ensures data persistence.

The project employs a clean architecture approach, with a structured folder breakdown including View, Service, Model, Widget, and Network directories. This modular approach reduces dependencies between project modules, enhancing maintainability and scalability. Moreover, the clean architecture design separates the presentation layer from the business layer, promoting code organization and readability.
